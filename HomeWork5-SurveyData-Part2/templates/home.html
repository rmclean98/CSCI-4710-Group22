		<h2> Motivation</h2>
		<p> The Covid-19 pandemic has changed lives of billions of people around the planet. People of all age groups are impacted by this unfortunate situation, even if they are not directly infected with the virus. The companies are able to continue with the business by adopting remote work policy where ever possible. Eventhough this situation has kept families closer, but it is getting evident that the lock down, continous remote work and staying isolated from friends and neighbourhood has impacted the emotional behaviour ofpeople. If we are able to understand what aspects of the emotional behaviour has been impacted by this situation, we can identify focus areas to help people get back to normalcy after the pandemic is over. Also the emotional impact may vary greatly depending on the Age group, Gender, Geography of the people. This website hosts the results of the survey taken across the globe on how people felt in terms of different emotions like Fear, Anxious, Anger, Happiness and Sadness during this pandemic situation and which emotion had the biggest impact on them. We have represented the survey results across the globe in a Map format and Ontology graph format. The user can click specific countries (in Map Format) and Nodes (in  ontology graph format) to view the detailed survey results of the same. We have grouped the detailed survey results into 4 tables/groups below.
Any Group having more than 10 records are further split into 3 sub groups based on KMeans algorithm. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Group-1</b>: Males with Age less than or equal to 35<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Group-2</b>: Males with Age Greater than or equal to 36<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Group-3</b>: Females with Age less than or equal to 35<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Group-4</b>: Females with Age greater than or equal to 36 <br><br>
